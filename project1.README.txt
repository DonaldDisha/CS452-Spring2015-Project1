My game is a 2D side scroller in which you are a spaceship escaping from the planet Xenu after you 
infiltrated their planet and foiled their plans to turn rain into candy. The Xenu leader wants 
you destroyed so he keeps throwing wierd rectangular objects at you to blow up your ship. 

Movement is done with the arrow keys, each object you avoid gives you a score of 2500 points and collision
with the object sets your score to 0.

To win this game, you only need to get 50000 points!

P.S Rocket Ship, Background, and Object color are random and change every time you refresh page!
